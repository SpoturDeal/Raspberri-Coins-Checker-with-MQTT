This script runs on NodeJS and need to be installed on the raspberry

Connect to Raspberry Pi via SSH and add NodeSource repository that maintains Node.js 16 binary distributions:

```
curl -sSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
```

Run command to install Node.js:
 
 ```
 sudo apt install -y nodejs
 ```
 
 Note that, we donâ€™t need to install npm separately, it comes bundled with Node.js. After the installation is complete, check Node.js and npm versions:
 If you see the versions the installation is succesfull.
 
 ```
 node --version
 npm --version
 ```

Now install MQTT

```
sudo npm install mqtt --save
```

Then install the command line tools

```
sudo npm install mqtt -g
```

The only missing requirement is bitvao

```
sudo npm install -y bitvavo
```

Copy the coins-check.js file to your directory.

# Use nano to enter your own credentials.

To start to script.

```
node coins-check.js
```

You can check with MQTT Explorer if the data is being published.

To autostart the script after reboot or startup edit your /etc/rc.local file
Add the following line

```
